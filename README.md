**Intro**
  
This project tests our abilities in responsize design.  A key step in becoming a truly badass UX developer.  Here we have applied the grid layout to a gallery of cards.  This gallery along with the contents of the header and the profile will adjust to various screen and browser sizes to allow for proper readability and functionality of many, many devices.   

**Updates 4-16-23**  
The status of all card elements are connected to a remote server which can be accessed via the Api class (Api.js).  All aspects the user profile (avatar picture, name, description) are als accessed via Api.
